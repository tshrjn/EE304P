###Our tasks :
## QPSK by direct mapping 
1. Observe what happens to the signal constellation as you vary the noise in the channel and the cutoff frequency of the filter.
2. Observe the effects of inter symbol interference (ISI) and why is it caused?
## QPSK modulator
1. Model PSK mod with packet encoder & decoder with an AWGN channel and see how the performance is affected by noise.
